# DIGIBOOK
DIGIBOOK uses the fundamentals of file handling in c++, and provides a tool to get in the knowledge of some basic concentration terms of chemistry.
The book provide some prior basic information about the concentration terms, and also allows to make notes and view previously written notes.
Book is also embedded with tools to calculate/compute concentration term.

**NOTE: It is adviced to run the program in Turbo c++, for better experience.**
